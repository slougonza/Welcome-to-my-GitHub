# Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Sarah Gonzalez and I am a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer. I love all things statistics, data visualizations, and machine learning, and am especially interested in natural language processing. I'm originally from Michigan, and I enjoy playing ice hockey, sewing my own clothes, reading long fantasy novels, and playing the piano! 

I have a Bachelors in Environmental Science with a specialization in natural resource management and I could talk for hours about how cool I think trees are! I'm also passionate about human and civil rights, community engagement, and poverty alleviation.
