# Welcome to my GitHub!
I'm Sarah and I'm a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer. I love all things statistics, data visualizations, and machine learning, and am especially interested in natural language processing. I'm originally from Michigan, and I enjoy playing ice hockey, sewing my own clothes, reading long fantasy novels, and playing the piano!

I have a Masters Degree in Applied Data Science and a Bachelors Degree in Environmental Science with a specialization in Natural Resource Management. I could talk for hours about how cool I think trees are! I'm also passionate about human and civil rights, community engagement, and food security.
